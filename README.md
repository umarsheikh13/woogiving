# WooGiving

This is an experimental plugin which adds a JustGiving payment gateway to WooCommerce.

## Installation

Download the master zip, extract it and upload it to your plugins directory. Once you active the plugin go to WooCommerce > Checkout > JustGiving to set it up.

## Gift Aid (UK only)

If you're accepting donations in exchange for products/services gift aid cannot be claimed. Unfortunately you can't prevent your donors from claiming gift aid so I would recommend using this plugin without providing anything in exchange for the donations.
